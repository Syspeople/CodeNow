# Which elements is added?
We intend support all "code only" functionality in ServiceNow, these elements have first priority.

Low code elements might get added, but _none_ is planned. 

No code elements will not added to the extension in a way that will allow you to configure them directly from VsCode.

# Features
* Work with multiple ServicNow record.
* Create new ServiceNow Records.
* Automatically saves to your instance.
* Automatically updates from your instance.
* Intellisense for ServiceNow and Angular API's.
* Change update Set.
* Create Update Set.
* Set Parent on created update set.

# How to
Add screenshots and stuff. 

# Try it
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed either way. make sure the path variable is up to date (reboot).

Only Basic auth is currently available. 


## Vscode Debugger
1. Clone and open repository
2. rebuild module dependencies using command "npm install" (make sure you are located in the workspace root)
3. start debugger
4. when debugging open a workspace (a folder)
5. invoke command: Connect to ServiceNow

## Package and install
1. Clone the repository. Remember do have the branch you want checked out and synced.
2. Install Visual Studio Code Extensions: **npm install -g vsce** 
3. Open a terminal and cd to root dir of your repository.
4. package extension: **vsce package**
5. Open Vscode and use command: install from vsix
6. navigate to packaged vsix from step 4 and open it.

## Intellisense
Currently there is intellisense for the following API's.

NB: Some API's are not fully documented (Publicly anyways). if you miss a method or attribute please create an issue.

### ServerSide API's
* GlideRecord
* GlideSystem (gs)
* GlideSPScriptable ($sp)
* GlideUser
* GlideAjax
* GlideDateTime
* GlideElement
* GlideElementDescriptor
* GlideSession
* GlideSysAttachment
* GlideEmailOutbound

### Angular API's / ServicePortal
* $http
* $scope
* $q
* $location
* spModal
* controller (angular controller class)

### Additional
To avoid collision between Class names and global variables classes in the declaration is always named using CamelCase.

eg.: 
* $q is $Q
* $http is $Http

### ClientSide API's
* GlideAjax

## Manually Specify Types
Occassionally it is required to manually specify a type in order for Vs Code to properly identify class and provide intellisense.

### Angular DI classes
use jsdoc notation to specify a type to make it available in scope.
```javascript
/**
 * @param {$Scope} $scope 
 * @param {$Http} $http 
 */
function ($scope, $http)
{
    var c = this;
}
```

### Custom Objects created in code.
Use JsDoc notation to autocomplete on custom object mappings declared and used in code. 
```javascript
/**
 * @type {SpModalOptions}
 */
var opt = {
    widget: "widget-form", widgetInput: {}
};

spModal.open(opt).then(function (res)
{
    console.log("modal end");
});
```

# Commands
